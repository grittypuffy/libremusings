Obligatory 'Hello world' to my fellow humans!

``` c
printf("Hello world");
```
``` rust
println!("Hello world");
```
``` go
fmt.Println("Hello world")
```
``` lisp
(message "Hello world")
```
```python
print("Hello world")
```
``` ts
console.log("Hello world");
```

# `whoami`

An unapologetic free software and DEIA advocate with heightened fear of being a hypocrite, which pushes me to stay true to my words and being devoted towards building and developing anything free and open source: software, hardware, communities. Because, at last, it's all about the ecosystem, isn't it?

Apart from that, I am a person with a lot of unrelated (or varied?) interests, because that's what life is about, enjoying the finer things. Some of them (because I can't include all) are:

- Programming, especially Rust, C, Go, Elisp and other low-level and functional programming languages
- Emacs (Vim users, fight me)
- OpenBSD and GNU/Linux (any FOSS operating system)
- Security and privacy
- Books on history, futuristic themes, fiction, any genre
- Free software community and ecosystem
- Accessibility and user experience
- Music, especially playing keyboard
- Ancient Indian history and literature
- Languages (it's fun to learn, mental exercise)
- Medical systems
