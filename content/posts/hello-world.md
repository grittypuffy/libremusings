Hello! வணக்கம்! വണക്കം! నమస్కారం! नमस्कार! こんにちは!

There we go with greetings in every language that I can read and write (well not 100%, but yeah)

# `whoami`

An unapologetic free software and DEIA advocate who prefers following what I preach (because being a hypocrite sounds terrible), devoted to building and developing anything free and open source: software, hardware, communities. Because, at last, it's all about the ecosystem, isn't it?

# Interests

I have a lot of unrelated (sometimes related) interests, because that's what life is about, enjoying the finer things. Some of them (because I can't include all):

- Programming, especially Rust, C, Go, Elisp and other low-level and functional languages
- Emacs (Vim users, fight me)
- OpenBSD and GNU/Linux, any FOSS operating system
- Security and privacy
- Books on history and future, although I love fiction too
- Free software community and ecosystem
- Accessibility and user experience
- Music, especially playing keyboard
- Ancient Indian history and literature
- Languages (it's fun to learn, mental exercise)
