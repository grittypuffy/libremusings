# `gritty` + `puffy` = `grittypuffy`

- `gritty` as we all know equates to grit, refering to relentless efforts needed for making FOSS accessible to everyone while ensuring you don't burn out as it's a thankless job.
- `puffy` refers to the mascot of OpenBSD (love it!) and since I am an OpenBSD user and was absolutely intrigued and mesmerized by the simplicity, stability and security (two remote holes, in heck of a long time never fails to amaze me) when I first started using it. As a cybersecurity undergraduate, this is something I need to live a sane life and not get sucked by bloat and complex design patterns.

It's a reminder to myself to never lose the vision or grit I set for myself way before entering the college and a year after learning about free software: Making FOSS and security accessible (with some selfish desires to make a startup out of it and cherish my loved ones)

Hoping that becomes a reality.

# Why Kirby as profile pic if you're a free software advocate?

I know, Kirby is Nintendo's trademark, but I can't help but adore the cute puffball (you're not human if your heart doesn't melt when Kirby says "Poyo", fight me!)
