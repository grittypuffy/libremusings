I am a final year undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering (Cybersecurity). I volunteer with free software and DEIA communities for improving free software contribution, inclusion and accessibility due to lived experiences.

I currently run [FOSSIA](https://fossia.org), a women-centric community formed to equip and encourage underrepresented people to contribute to the Indian free software ecosystem by building inclusive and accessible technologies.

I develop [Mounam (work-in-progress)](https://fossia.org/blog/mounathin-kural) and [TranscribeIt](https://fossia.org/blog/givingtuesday-with-transcribeit) for improving accessibility for the Indian deaf community.

I contribute code to projects for improving accessibility, with some of my recent involvements being:
- [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org), where I volunteered for Chennai chapter and IndiaFOSS 2025.
- [Serene](https://github.com/grittypuffy/serene), the theme used for this website.

Check out my GitHub for more information.

I am preparing for CPACC certification and Azure AI-102 for developing responsible AI solutions with accessibility in mind for my newly founded inclusive technology startup named [InLibre (Inclusive + Libre)](https://inlibre.io).

# A brief outlook into the past

My passion for computers came when I made peace with a mobile IDE (Integrated Development Environment) during COVID, when I was a teen. It started with building small and insignificant terminal games and apps in Python.

Slowly, that allowed me to solve my own problems, making me more lazier. The dopamine hit that I got when I finished a program after breaking my head due to lack of resources (mind you, I am talking about 2020, when there were no LLMs) got me hooked to programming.

# Getting into free software

Like any other hyped teen, I was planning to get into security because it seemed cool. I did courses, scripted and fiddled with my laptop, until a privacy concern with WhatsApp flooded social media.

Following that, I ditched mainstream, proprietary applications in favor of free software applications. I investigated about the Free Software Foundation and the movement. Countless hours were spent in reading about issues in the free software world and its intersection in the societal and political landscapes.

I decided to write and contribute to free software ecosystem, since that is the most powerful form of advocacy and expression.

As a result. my work naturally has a touch of freedom and security.

# Devoting to DEIA

A series of personal experiences and observations around my university and society provoked a question: How much better the world would be if kindness, inclusion and accessibility were the defaults?

That led me to start working on DEIA initiatives and apply my background in security and free software for writing assistive technologies.

Inclusion and accessibility should no longer be a dream is what I wish for.
