# gritty + puffy = grittypuffy

- **'gritty'** as we all know equates to grit, refering to relentless efforts needed for making FOSS accessible to everyone while ensuring you don't burn out as it's a thankless job.
- **'puffy'** refers to the mascot of OpenBSD (love it!) and since I am an OpenBSD user and was absolutely intrigued and mesmerized by the simplicity, stability and security (two remote holes, in heck of a long time never fails to amaze me) when I first started using it. As a cybersecurity undergraduate, this is something I need to live a sane life and not get sucked by bloat and complex design patterns.

It's a reminder to myself to never lose the vision or grit I set for myself way before entering the college and a year after learning about free software: Making FOSS and security accessible (with some selfish desires to make a startup out of it and cherish my loved ones)

Hoping that becomes a reality.

# Why Kirby as profile picture if you're a free software advocate?

I know, Kirby is Nintendo's trademark, but I can't help but adore the cute puffball (you're not human if your heart doesn't melt when Kirby says "Poyo", fight me!)

Update [2025-04-30]: I, no longer have Kirby as a profile picture. So this doesn't apply.

# What does your profile picture mean?

The girl from my profile picture is from a Manhwa named "I Have Something to Tell You". Her name is Ga-ram (pronounced Garam), a child born out of resilience of a mother who went through a tragic accident that caused her to die after her birth. The profile picture captures her last words (better to tell it as thoughts, since she's mute from birth) -- "I love you" (well, I am not going to spoil the Manhwa, give it a read, it's awesome!) to her estranged twin she's reconciled with before she's stabbed out of a misunderstanding.

The way she interacted with her long lost twin, her resilience and optimism are contagious.

The beauty of the Manhwa is, I read this exactly a year before (April 28, 2024) Mounam was conceptualized in the summer of 2025, the open-access Indian Sign Language directory that I am working on under [FOSSIA](https://fossia.org).
