# Hey there!

Keerthana here. I go by the alias `@grittypuffy`. [For more information on my alias `grittypuffy`, (read "What's in a name?")](/posts/whats-in-a-name) on the Internet.

I enjoy:
- Cranking code on high
- Advocating for free software and DEIA
- Contributing to open-source projects for accessibility improvements
- Researching on accessibility
- Pondering over meaning of our existence, and
- Other finer aspects of life, with special interest towards music, art, history and photography.

When not hooked up to my ThinkPad, you can find me reading books, spending time with family or sleeping with my plush dolls.

I express my views (and rants) on several topics of interest. Views expressed here are purely mine, independent of the organizations I am associated with.

# Get in touch

If you're interested in DEIA, free software, writing accessible software or want to discuss about random topics of interests mentioned above, feel free to [send a mail to grittypuffy@riseup.net](mailto:grittypuffy@riseup.net)

If you are encountering accessibility issues with the website, [please send me an e-mail with subject titled "Accessibility - libremusings"](mailto:grittypuffy@riseup.net?subject=Accessibility%20-%20libremusings), I will definitely take it into consideration and fix it.

# Note

The website is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. I am working on WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance by adding themes and typography.

If you have any suggestions, [please reach out via e-mail](mailto:grittypuffy@riseup.net).
