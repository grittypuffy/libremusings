# Hello there

I am Keerthana (she/her), an open-source contributor to accessibility projects, for one among many things.

I go by the alias `@grittypuffy` on the Internet([Read the story behind my Internet alias 'grittypuffy'](/posts/whats-in-a-name))

I am involved with:
- Cranking code on high
- Advocating for free software and DEIA under [FOSSIA](https://fossia.org)
- Contributions to open-source projects for accessibility improvements
- Research and development on accessibility and inclusive education
- Pondering over meaning of existence (and other finer aspects of life)
- Getting immersed in music, art, history and photography

When not hooked up to my ThinkPad, you can find me reading books, spending time with family or sleeping with my plush dolls.

I express my views (and rants) on several topics of interest. Views expressed here are purely mine, independent of the organizations I am associated with.

# Get in touch

If you're interested in:
- Free software and volunteering for DEIA
- Writing assistive technologies or accessible software
- Making your websites or applications more accessible
- Discussing about random and interesting topics

Feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:grittypuffy@riseup.net), I will be happy to chat and collaborate.

[Please e-mail me for any accessibility issues](mailto:grittypuffy@riseup.net?subject=Accessibility%20-%20libremusings). I will definitely take it into consideration and fix it as soon as possible.
